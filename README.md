# Longest_Common_Subsequence_example
A simple script to find the [longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence) (and relative score) given two input file 

## HOW TO USE:

prepare two input file (see my inputA.txt and inputB.txt for examples) and put it the same folder of the exe of the program (or specify a path in the code) and run the code

##CUSTOMIZATION:
You can adjust the score assigned to the type of occurrences by modifying the global variables at the start of the code.
At the moment the code check if the occurrences are either numbers, special chars, alphabetical chars or formattation (space, tabs etc) but you can obviously add more checks.

## THE MATRIX:

setting the bool 'pmatrix' to true from false, will print (in addition to the longest common subsequence and its score) also the score matrix table.

## THE CODE IS GIVEN AS IS, I DO NOT PLAN TO SUPPORT IT OR ANYTHING ELSE
